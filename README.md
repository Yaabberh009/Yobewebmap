**Yobe State Healthcare Facilities Interactive Web Map**

**Overview:**

This project is an interactive web map showcasing healthcare facilities across Yobe State, Nigeria. It was developed as part of our participation in the 2024 Digital Nigeria Innovation Challenge, with a specific focus on healthcare in Yobe State. The map provides a detailed breakdown of healthcare facilities, ranging from primary to tertiary levels, offering policymakers, development partners, and stakeholders the ability to make data-driven decisions regarding healthcare accessibility, distribution, and planning within the state.

**Purpose:**

This project aims to bridge gaps in healthcare accessibility by visualizing the distribution of healthcare facilities across Yobe State. While primary healthcare facilities are widespread, there is a visible shortage of secondary and tertiary referral points. This map can serve as a critical tool for:
•	Healthcare Policy Formulation
•	Resource Allocation and Planning
•	Improving Access to Specialized Healthcare
•	Capacity Building for Public Health Interventions

**Features:**

•	Layered Display: Shows Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary healthcare facilities.
•	Interactive**: Users can zoom in/out, measure distances, and click on data points to reveal detailed insights such as facility category, ownership, functionality, and type.
•	Search Functionality: Easy to locate specific facilities.
•	User-Friendly Tools: Includes zooming, searching, and measurement tools for enhanced user experience.

**Data Sources:**

1.	Open Government Database (Grid3 Nigeria): Providing spatial data to support evidence-based decision-making.
2.	Yobe State Primary Healthcare Management Board (YPHMB): Supplying facility-level information for primary healthcare centers.

**Impact:**

The Yobe State Healthcare Facilities Interactive Web Map will help identify areas that require more healthcare resources, ensuring equitable access to healthcare services. It highlights gaps in the distribution of referral centers and allows the government, stakeholders, and health professionals to strategize interventions effectively.

**Why This Matters?**

With healthcare being one of the most critical pillars of development, this project allows us to align with the goals of the Digital Nigeria Innovation Challenge—fostering technology and innovation to address real-world problems. The project is also an invaluable asset to the government of Yobe State and healthcare organizations, ensuring that evidence-based decisions can be made to improve healthcare service delivery.

**Contributors:**

This project was developed by a team of five professionals, all locals of Yobe State, bringing together a wealth of experience in data management, public health, GIS, and software development.
